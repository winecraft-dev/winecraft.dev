## Catching Up 
Hey, it's been a long time since I've posted anything onto my website. When I first went live in the summer of 2022, I was settling into NYC and waiting to start my first SWE job at Capital One. Now, 3.5 years later, I'm getting back into coding, dusting off this website, and searching for a new job back in Software.

I'm not really sure why I setup this website back then. I was definitely bored, probably excited to get into the realm of real software engineering, and maybe hoping to consistently do my own creative coding projects. For the first few months, I did a decent job of documenting a few projects from that summer and college beforehand. But since then, anyone who stumbled onto this website could be left thinking this is just another graveyard portfolio site hosted to get that first job.

I won't lie, I am looking for a job. I'm currently unemployed after leaving my last job serving at a Chinese Restaurant. I won't get into why I left Software Engineering because the reasons are cliche and self-explanatory. But since I stopped coding, I've tried holding onto my engineering mindset by working on projects focused on electronics and 3d printing.

This post about my 3D printed file storage server may or may not be the first of many. I cannot guarantee anything, but I'm promising to rekindle my creativity and passion. I hope that by posting here, I keep myself accountable and consistent and eventually put myself back in the profession I first loved.
